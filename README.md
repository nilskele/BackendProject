# Steps to Run the Laravel Project Locally (Using XAMPP and SQLite)
## 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that the following tools are installed:

- PHP (installed via XAMPP, make sure you're using PHP 8.x or above)
- Composer (for managing PHP dependencies)
- XAMPP (to manage Apache, PHP, and SQLite)
- Download XAMPP
- SQLite (already included in XAMPP)

## 2. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-laravel-project.git
cd your-laravel-project

## 3. Install PHP Dependencies
Once you've cloned the project, you need to install the PHP dependencies using Composer. Run the following command:

composer install
This will download and install all the PHP packages required for your project as defined in composer.json.

## 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Next, you need to set up your environment variables. Copy the .env.example file to a new .env file:

cp .env.example .env
Open the .env file and configure your SQLite database settings. Since you're using SQLite with XAMPP, youâ€™ll configure it like so: 

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/your-laravel-project/database/database.sqlite
Make sure that the DB_DATABASE path points to where the SQLite database file is located. You can also create the database.sqlite file manually inside the database/ directory if it doesn't exist yet.

## 5. Mailtrap Integration for Sending Emails
To send emails locally using Mailtrap:

Sign up at Mailtrap.io and create a new inbox.
Copy the SMTP credentials provided by Mailtrap.
Update your .env file with the following Mailtrap credentials:
env
Copy code
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailtrap_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailtrap_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="no-reply@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
## 6. Generate the Application Key
Laravel requires an application key for encryption. To generate the key, run:

php artisan key:generate
This will generate a new key and update your .env file automatically.

## 7. Set Up the SQLite Database
Now, let's create the SQLite database.
Go to the database/ directory in your project folder.
Create a new SQLite database file:

touch database.sqlite
This will create an empty SQLite database file that Laravel will use.

## 8. Run Migrations (Optional)
If your project includes database migrations, you need to run them to set up your database schema. Run the following command:

php artisan migrate
This will create the necessary tables in your SQLite database.

## 9. Install JavaScript Dependencies
If your project uses front-end assets (e.g., Vue.js, React, etc.), you need to install the JavaScript dependencies using npm:

npm install
This will install the JavaScript packages required for your front-end code.

## 10. Compile the Assets
If your project uses Laravel Mix or other asset bundlers, you need to compile your assets. Run:

npm run dev

This will compile your assets (CSS, JS, etc.) for local development.

## 11. Start XAMPP and Serve the Application
Open XAMPP and start the following services:

Apache (for serving the app)
To run the Laravel application locally, you don't need a database server since you're using SQLite. Run the following command:

php artisan serve
By default, the application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

## 12. Access the Application
Once the server is running, you can access your application at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000
You should now be able to see the project running locally!
